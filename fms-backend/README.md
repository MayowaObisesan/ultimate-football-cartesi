# Ultimate Football Backend

This is the backend for Ultimate Football built on Cartesi

This Backend runs on Cartesi and is built using the Python programming language.

To run this backend code, simply cd into the backend folder, then run;
`sunodo build` followed by `sunodo run`.
In case `sunodo run` fails, run `sudo chmod 777 .sunodo/image`.

Now try running `sunodo run` once again.

The cartesi node will be running now.
